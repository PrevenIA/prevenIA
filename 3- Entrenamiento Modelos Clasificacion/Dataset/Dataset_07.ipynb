       "'Esto sucedió cuando estaba en mi primer año de secundaria, entonces tenía 12 años y cumplía 13. Estaba teniendo mi primer episodio de psicosis (aún no me diagnosticaron pero tengo trastorno bipolar). Tenía insomnio y escuchaba voces. Me iba muy mal en la escuela, no podía concentrarme en clase y mis profesores me castigaban por no completar la tarea, apoyar la cabeza en la mesa en clase y soñar despierta. Un día, mi maestra se me acercó y me preguntó si algo andaba mal. Le dije que no podía dormir y que estaba escuchando voces. Luego me remitió al consejero escolar.\\n\\nLa consejera era una mujer de pelo corto y rizado. Ella era muy amable y muy querida por los estudiantes. Mis amigos y yo íbamos a su oficina y simplemente hablábamos con ella durante el recreo. Entonces sentí que podía confiar en ella.\\n\\nLas primeras sesiones estuvieron bien hasta que un día entré a su habitación y ella cerró la puerta con llave. Cerró las persianas y apagó las luces. Yo estaba sentado en el sofá y ella se sentó en la mesa muy cerca de mí, nuestras rodillas se tocaban. Ella seguía diciendo \"todo va a estar bien\" y procedió a frotarme los muslos y debajo de la falda.\\n\\nNo podía moverme. A esa edad no sabía lo que estaba pasando. Pensé que todos los consejeros hacían eso. Finalmente se detuvo, me dijo que me fuera y cerró la puerta con llave. Al día siguiente, le dije a mi maestra que había intentado suicidarme y ella se lo contó a mi consejera. El consejero me envió al hospital psiquiátrico. Los siguientes 4 años que pasé en la escuela, ella intentaba evitar que yo no pudiera mirarme a los ojos.\\n\\nRealmente me jodió porque la persona que se suponía que debía ayudarme, me lastimó.\\n\\nAhora tengo 21 años y estudio para ser consejero. Quiero ser la persona que necesitaba cuando era más joven y demostrar que ella era una mala excusa como consejera.\\n\\nRecientemente, mi trabajadora social me preguntó si quería presentar una denuncia policial. Le dije que no, porque ha pasado mucho tiempo, pero me preocupa que ella le haya estado haciendo eso a otros niños. Qué piensas'"
